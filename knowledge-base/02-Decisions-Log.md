Chronological record of non-obvious choices and why they were made. Each entry: what was decided, why, what alternatives were considered.

## Inspector-assignment LP over budget-knapsack (kept both)

**Decision**: Replace the original `ResourceOptimizer` (budget-knapsack: "which projects get funded under a budget cap") with a new `InspectorAssignmentOptimizer` (assignment problem: "which inspector visits which project") as the one `main.py` actually uses.

**Why**: The manuscript and the PPDO stakeholders' actual problem is inspector routing/scheduling under a 5-6-person roster, not project funding selection. The original code solved a different, easier problem that didn't match the thesis's stated Objective 4 or the DFD Level 2 (Optimization Engine) diagram.

**Alternative considered**: Delete `ResourceOptimizer` entirely. **Rejected** — kept it in `optimization.py` for comparison/historical reference since it doesn't hurt to keep, and removing working code the user didn't ask to remove is unnecessary churn.

## Manual round-robin + Monte Carlo random, not hardcoded stats, as baselines

**Decision**: Benchmark the LP against (a) a manual round-robin baseline (mirrors current PPDO practice — visit projects in list order) and (b) a 100-iteration Monte Carlo random-assignment baseline, both computed for real every run.

**Why**: The original code had `mc_results = {"n_successful": 100, "std_improvement_pct": 3.2, ...}` hardcoded as constants, misrepresenting a specific run's numbers as if they were general properties of the algorithm. This would not survive a thesis defense.

## Supabase over SQLite/better-sqlite3

**Decision**: User explicitly chose Supabase (hosted Postgres) when asked how to implement the "replace CSV/JSON with a database" objective, overriding the initially-proposed local SQLite + `better-sqlite3` approach.

**Why** (inferred from the ask): matches the manuscript's own "PostgreSQL available for production deployment" line, gives free hosted Postgres + Auth + RLS in one product, avoids native-module install friction (`better-sqlite3` requires prebuilt binaries).

**Consequence**: I cannot run schema DDL directly (no direct Postgres connection, only the service-role REST key) — every schema change requires the user to paste SQL into the Supabase dashboard manually. See [[04-Workflows-and-Gotchas#Schema changes require a manual step]].

## supabase-py for the backend write path (not raw psycopg2)

**Decision**: User chose the `supabase-py` client library over a direct `psycopg2`/SQLAlchemy Postgres connection for the pipeline's write path.

**Why**: Matches Supabase's officially recommended pattern; the backend already writes via a service-role REST client rather than needing raw SQL/connection-string management.

## Login page: reuse the existing mock UI, delete the newly-built duplicate

**Decision**: Discovered mid-implementation that a polished login/landing page already existed at the site root (`src/app/page.tsx`) — hardcoded fake credentials (`admin@iloilo.gov.ph`), no real auth, just `router.push("/dashboard")` on submit. I had already built a separate, plainer `/login` page wired to real Supabase Auth. Once the mismatch surfaced (user tried logging in via the root page, got confused by a proxy redirect to the different-looking `/login`), the decision was: wire real Supabase Auth into the **existing, nicer** root page, and delete the newly-built `/login` page rather than keeping two login screens.

**Why**: One login screen, using the design that was already built and presumably intentional (branding, copy, footer disclaimer already written). `src/proxy.ts`'s public path became `/` instead of `/login`.

## Role visibility: Manager sees User Management too, not Admin-only

**Decision**: Both Manager and Admin can view the Users page / Account Access panel; only Inspector is excluded from nav. Only Admin can create accounts or change roles (Manager can view the account list but not mutate it).

**Why**: User's own phrasing when specifying role scope was "Manager sees everything (dashboard, allocation, reports, user management)" — explicitly listing user management as part of Manager's full access, with Admin's distinguishing responsibility being *managing credentials* specifically (create/role-change), not exclusive page access. Confirmed via an explicit follow-up question when the ambiguity was noticed.

## Dashboard/Projects/Forecast Engine scoped to the same 450-project cohort as everything else

**Decision**: When migrating `/api/projects` off the static `demo_projects.csv` (150 hand-picked rows), scope it to the same ~450-project "currently monitored" cohort that `predictions`/`assignments` already cover — not all 3000 rows in the `projects` table.

**Why**: Consistency. Timeline/Reports/Allocation already only show this cohort (the projects that have been scored by the most recent pipeline run). Showing a different, larger, unscored set on Dashboard/Projects would mean some pages have risk tiers for a project and others don't — confusing and inconsistent. It also means Inspector-role scoping (via the `assignments` table) works identically across every page with no special-casing.

## Map pins via deterministic centroid jitter, not real per-project coordinates

**Decision**: Since the synthetic `projects` table only stores a municipality name (not coordinates), and the original `demo_projects.csv` turned out to already be using municipality-centroid + jitter (verified by averaging its per-project lat/lng per municipality), replicate that same approach: a static centroid lookup (`iloiloMunicipalityCentroids.ts`) + a deterministic hash-based jitter keyed on `project_id`, so each project always renders at the same pin across requests.

**Why**: Cheapest way to keep the map feature working without adding real geocoding, backend schema changes, or a new data source, and it matches the fidelity level the original demo data already had (it was never real per-project GPS data either).

## Obsidian knowledge-base vault, git-tracked, auto-updated

**Decision**: Build `/knowledge-base` in the repo root as a git-tracked Obsidian vault, and update it automatically after significant work rather than waiting to be asked.

**Why**: User's stated goal is surviving `/compact` and fresh sessions without re-deriving context or hallucinating prior decisions. Git-tracked means it travels with clones/branches and stays versioned alongside the code it describes.

## Operational workflow: photo upload, accept-only (no decline), report gated on acceptance

**Decision**: When scoping the assign→accept→submit-report feature (surfaced by a full codebase audit against the PPDO's stated workflow), three explicit choices were made via direct questions rather than assumed:
1. Reports include photo upload (not just data fields) — requires a Supabase Storage bucket, an extra manual setup step for the user.
2. Inspectors can only **accept** an assignment, not decline it. If an inspector genuinely can't do a visit, that's handled outside the app (contact the Manager) rather than a formal decline/reassignment flow. Simpler, and avoids needing to model "assignment goes back to the pool" without re-running the offline LP.
3. Submitting a report **requires** the assignment to already be `accepted` (enforced server-side, 409 if not) — matches the real-world sequence (accept the visit → go inspect → submit) rather than allowing a report for any assigned project regardless of acceptance state.

**Why**: These aren't obvious defaults — a simpler v1 could've skipped photos, allowed decline, or left reports ungated — so the choices are recorded here to avoid re-litigating or "simplifying" them away in a future session.

**Consequence**: `inspection_reports.photo_urls` is a `text[]` column, uploaded to a public `inspection-photos` Storage bucket directly from the browser client (using the user's own session, not the service-role key — Storage RLS policies, not table RLS, gate this). `assignments.status` has only two values (`pending`, `accepted`), no `declined`. `POST /api/reports/submit` returns 409 if the assignment isn't accepted yet.

## Old per-inspector-card "Accept AI Allocation" button replaced with per-project-row controls

**Decision**: The original Allocation page (inherited from the pre-Supabase mockup) had one "Accept AI Allocation" button per inspector card — accepting an entire day's schedule as one blob, and not wired to anything (local component state only, reset on refresh). Redesigned to per-project-row Accept/Submit Report/Reported controls instead.

**Why**: A real PPDO inspector doesn't accept or decline their *entire schedule* as a unit — acceptance is naturally per-assignment (per-project). The audit that surfaced this also found the button did nothing persistent, so it was actively misleading about state, not just wrong-grained.

## Defer further mobile/table UI polish to a future full UI revamp

**Decision**: After a baseline mobile-responsiveness pass (sidebar drawer, table horizontal scroll, layout stacking — commit `e11ee9b`), the user tested again and found table/chart rendering on mobile still not fully satisfactory. Rather than keep iterating incrementally on the *current* design's responsive behavior, the user decided to defer further polish to a planned full UI revamp, and redirected focus to backend/core-workflow items.

**Why**: The current page designs (wide multi-column tables, dense stat rows, Gantt charts) were built mockup-first without mobile in mind; incremental CSS patches (horizontal scroll, stacking, wrapping) improve things but don't fundamentally solve the mismatch between "desktop dashboard density" and "phone screen." A future revamp can redesign these views mobile-first (e.g. card-based lists instead of tables) rather than continuing to retrofit.

**Consequence**: Don't re-attempt incremental mobile CSS fixes on the current page designs unless explicitly asked — the baseline (`e11ee9b`) is considered "good enough for now," and the user wants a redesign, not further patching, when this comes up again. Loading states (a related, smaller polish item) were also left unstarted for the same reason — likely folds into the same future revamp.

## Branch renamed before opening the PR

**Decision**: Renamed `fix/inspector-assignment-alignment` → `feat/supabase-migration-and-operational-workflow` before pushing/opening the PR.

**Why**: The branch name was accurate for its first commit only. By the time it was ready to merge it carried 16 commits spanning the entire Supabase migration, Auth/RBAC, password self-service, the operational workflow, Reports-page merge, mobile responsiveness, and the PRD — "inspector assignment" would have badly undersold the PR's actual scope to a reviewer. Safe to rename locally since the branch hadn't been pushed to `origin` yet at the time.

## PR #1 merged via squash-and-merge

**Decision**: Merged PR #1 (the entire branch above, 16 commits) into `main` using GitHub's "Squash and merge," collapsing everything into a single commit (`7932d3e`) on `main`.

**Why**: The branch's 16 commits mixed real feature commits with small `docs: update knowledge-base vault` housekeeping commits after nearly every feature — squashing avoids `main`'s log being cluttered with those interstitial doc-sync commits, at the cost of losing per-feature `git bisect`/`git blame` granularity for this PR.

**Consequence**: The squash commit's message follows the template (Description + a trimmed "Changes made" bullet list) — not a copy-paste of the full PR body (no how-to-test steps, no screenshot links, no files-changed list; those either don't render in a terminal or are already available via `git log --stat`).

## FR-13 (report review/approval): scope and design

**Decision**: Chosen as the next priority after PR #1 merged, over FR-14 (ML feedback loop) and FR-15 (ISO/IEC 25010) — smallest, best-bounded scope, builds directly on the existing accept/submit workflow rather than needing more real data volume or being a non-coding deliverable. Scoped via explicit questions:
1. **Who can act**: Manager and Admin both (matches their existing shared full-read-access pattern; only Inspector is excluded).
2. **Notification**: reuse the existing notification-bell/`risk_alerts` system rather than building a new channel — but see [[04-Workflows-and-Gotchas]] for why this had to be *derived on read*, not stored in `risk_alerts` directly.
3. **Resubmission**: allowed. An Inspector can resubmit after "needs revision," which resets review to pending.
4. **Naming**: a new, separate "Review Status" badge (Awaiting Review/Approved/Needs Revision) rather than overloading the existing progress-based `status` field (Validated/Pending Review/Flagged/Submitted) — both use "Pending Review"-shaped language but mean different things, so keeping them visually and structurally distinct avoids confusing a reviewer who sees both on the same row.

**Consequence**: Resubmission needed no explicit "reset review status" logic — a resubmission is just a new `inspection_reports` row, which defaults to `review_status = 'pending'` like any other insert, and the existing "latest report wins" merge (now `pickLatestByKey()`, see [[04-Workflows-and-Gotchas]]) naturally surfaces it as the current, actionable one.

## FR-13 review actions moved from inline table buttons to a full detail modal

**Decision**: The first pass put Approve/Request Revision buttons directly in the Reports table row (`ReportReviewModal` handled only the revision comment). After shipping it, the user asked how a Manager/Admin would actually see the notes and photos before deciding — and the honest answer was "barely": the row only had space for 32×32 thumbnails and truncated/italic text, disconnected from the review action next to it. Replaced with `ReportDetailModal`: a single modal showing full-size photos, complete text, and both accomplishment percentages, with Approve/Request Revision inline below the evidence. `ReportReviewModal` was deleted rather than kept alongside it, since its one job (the revision comment) is now a mode within the bigger modal — no reason to keep two overlapping components.

**Why**: A review action needs to be next to what's being reviewed, not just next to a badge. Approve requires no comment (single click); Request Revision requires a non-empty comment, enforced both client-side (`ReportDetailModal`) and server-side (`PATCH /api/reports/[reportId]/review`).

**Consequence**: Surfaced and fixed an unrelated pre-existing gap while at it — `financial_accomplishment_pct` was already being fetched by `/api/reports` from `inspection_reports` but never included in the API response, so it was invisible to every frontend page, not just the review flow. Now exposed alongside `actualProgress` (physical %).

## Renamed the slippage-based Status value "Pending Review" to "At Risk"

**Decision**: The user spotted, via a Reports-page screenshot, that the pre-existing slippage-based `status` column's "Pending Review" value read as the same concept as the new Review Status column's "Awaiting Review" — even though the deliberate distinction made when scoping FR-13 (see above) was to keep them structurally separate. Fixed by renaming the *older* value to "At Risk," rather than touching the new Review Status wording.

**Why**: "At Risk" describes what it actually is — an automated slippage-severity heuristic — with no implication of human review at all, closing the wording gap the FR-13 naming decision didn't fully anticipate. No logic change: `statusFromSlippage()`'s thresholds (>20 Flagged, >5 previously-"Pending Review"-now-"At Risk", else Validated) are unchanged, only the label. No `Co-Authored-By` trailer on this or future commits — the user asked for it to be dropped.

## FR-14 reframed: prediction-vs-reality tracking, not an ML feedback loop

**Decision**: FR-14 was originally phrased in the PRD as "real report data feeds back into retraining." Investigating the actual pipeline before building anything surfaced two blockers: (1) real `inspection_reports` only ever capture an interim signal (physical/financial accomplishment % at one point in time) — never the final `is_delayed`/`delay_days`/`is_cost_overrun`/`cost_overrun_pct` outcome the models actually train on, which `synthetic_generator.py` can only know because the data is synthetic; a real project's true outcome isn't knowable until it closes out, months or years later. (2) The manuscript's own delimitation (`07-PRD.md` §6) explicitly excludes "real-time/continuous model retraining within the research timeline" — building a retraining loop would contradict the thesis's own declared scope.

Reframed and built instead as **prediction-vs-reality tracking**: a new read-only "Model Validation" page comparing each project's predicted risk tier (from `predictions`) against its latest real report's progress slippage, with a Confirmed/Contradicted/Inconclusive read per project. Zero retraining, zero model changes.

**Why**: This gives the thesis defense a legitimate, buildable "here's how the model holds up against real field data" evaluation angle — distinct from Objective 2's existing synthetic-test-set metrics — without overstating what's actually possible with the real data volume/shape that exists, and without contradicting the manuscript's own scope delimitation.

**Scoping choices**: Compares delay/progress risk only, not cost-overrun — interim `financial_accomplishment_pct` isn't a meaningful proxy for "will this project cost-overrun" the way progress slippage is a meaningful proxy for "is this project running late" (financial % is still shown for context, just not used to compute agreement). Only lists projects with at least one real report — nothing to validate against otherwise. No filters in this first version, since real report volume is currently a handful of rows (test accounts only) — add if/when volume grows, same reasoning as why Reports' filters were justified by its ~450-row scale.

**Consequence**: Extracted `expectedProgressPct()` out of `/api/reports/route.ts` into a shared `frontend/src/lib/projectProgress.ts`, since the new `/api/model-validation` route needed the identical start-date/planned-duration math — same reuse pattern as `pickLatestByKey()`.

## Frontend UI revamp, Phase 1: design system + Dashboard flagship

**Decision**: The user asked to finally do the full UI revamp deferred earlier (see the mobile-responsiveness deferral entry above), with an explicit bar: professional, not "vibe-coded," real states, animation. Given the scale (9 pages + login), scoped via clarifying questions to build **one flagship page first** (Dashboard) rather than all pages at once, establishing a reusable design system before touching anything else.

Choices made:
1. **Fresh palette, formal/government/enterprise mood** — not a reskin of the old bright navy/blue, and not a generic "modern SaaS" look either (rejected as too bright/decorative for a government planning tool). Muted ink/surface/accent/status tokens in `frontend/src/styles/tokens.css`, individually WCAG-contrast-checked; the status (risk-tier) colors were run through the dataviz skill's `validate_palette.js` validator rather than eyeballed — see the note below on what that check does and doesn't cover.
2. **Framer Motion** for real animation (new dependency) over CSS-only transitions — chosen for its `layoutId` (the sliding nav-active-indicator) and spring physics (the mobile drawer), which plain CSS transitions can't do as cleanly.
3. **Tailwind was found already in `package.json` but never wired up** (`postcss.config.mjs` empty, not imported in `globals.css`) — left untouched rather than newly activating an unused framework mid-revamp; the design system is CSS custom properties + CSS Modules, the natural evolution of what was already there.

**Why status colors don't need to pass the categorical CVD-separation gate**: The dataviz skill's `validate_palette.js` validates *categorical* palettes (multiple simultaneously-plotted series that must be told apart by hue alone). Its own docs are explicit that this does not apply to a status/severity scale (good→warning→serious→critical) — the mitigation for low mutual hue-separation there is always **icon + label pairing**, never hue alone. This matters here because the Risk Tier Distribution chart legitimately displays all four status colors side-by-side (like a categorical chart would), but per the skill's docs the applicable check is still individual WCAG contrast + mandatory direct labels (which the chart already has — every bar prints its tier name and count in neutral ink, never relying on the color alone), not the categorical adjacent-pair gate. Spent real time confirming this before finalizing `--status-warning`/`--status-serious` (which are visually close and would fail a categorical adjacent-CVD check) rather than either forcing an artificial hue spread or skipping validation entirely.

**Consequence**: New reusable primitives in `frontend/src/components/ui/` (`Skeleton`, `Badge`, `EmptyState`, `StatCard`) and `frontend/src/lib/motion.ts` (shared variants/duration constants) exist now for the remaining 8-page rollout to reuse rather than re-invent. Centralized the `Alert` and `SessionProfile` types (previously redefined slightly differently in `Dashboard` and `TopRight`) into `frontend/src/lib/types.ts` and a type-only import of the existing server-side `SessionProfile`, respectively.

## Dashboard layout: triage-first, not a reskinned BI template

**Decision**: After the token/primitive pass, the user pushed further: "be more creative with the layout structure... don't mind the current existing layout." Proposed a genuinely reordered information hierarchy via an HTML mockup (published as an Artifact for approval before touching real code) rather than describing it in prose: **attention → context → browse**, replacing the generic **stats → charts → table** template every admin dashboard defaults to.

Concretely: the old large gradient "welcome banner" was replaced with a slim inline header (breadcrumb + greeting + inline Critical/High-Risk count pills); a new **"Needs Attention"** zone leads the page — a ranked list of Critical/High-risk projects (sorted by real `delay_probability` from `predictions`, not fabricated) paired with the AI Forecast Alerts feed; the four KPI totals and the Risk Tier Distribution chart are demoted to a **"Portfolio at a Glance"** section below it (both are portfolio *context*, not action items); the full "All Projects" table stays last, for browsing.

**Layout bugs found and fixed during user review** (both instructive for the eventual 8-page rollout):
- A CSS grid's default `align-items: stretch` made the shorter "Needs Attention" list card visually stretch to match its taller sibling, leaving dead white space rather than growing its content. Fixing this properly meant **re-pairing what's grouped with what** (moving the chart out of the attention zone, since stacking it with the alerts feed was what made that column taller than the single project list in the first place) rather than just changing `align-items`.
- Once re-paired, the two attention-zone cards were *still* not guaranteed to match height, since their row counts depend on live data (could be 2 alerts and 8 critical projects, or the reverse). Fixed by giving both a **fixed height with internally scrolling content** (`.attentionCard`/`.attentionCardBody`), not by relying on their natural content heights happening to match — the more robust fix, since it holds regardless of how the underlying data changes later.
- The top-bar search input was removed from the Dashboard entirely: it only ever filtered the 5-row "All Projects" preview table far below the fold (a disconnected, weak UX), and the dedicated Projects page already has full search + filters across the entire ~450-project cohort. Cut rather than fixed, since it didn't serve the page's actual job.

**Consequence**: Phase 1 (design system + Dashboard) is done and approved by the user. The other 8 pages + login stay on the old design until there's a decision on whether/how to roll this system out further — see [[06-Current-State-and-Next-Steps]].

## UI revamp Phase 2, Group A: Projects, Forecast Engine, Model Validation

**Decision**: User asked for a full layout rethink (not a reskin) for every remaining page, landing in a few grouped PRs. Group A (Projects, Forecast Engine, Model Validation) went first, chosen for biggest impact. Same mockup-first workflow as Dashboard: an `Explore` audit of all 9 remaining pages found real, page-specific issues before any design work started (see `03-Progress-Log.md` for the full audit findings) — cross-cutting ones worth remembering: **zero pages used tokens.css/Framer Motion before this**, `Badge`/`StatCard`-shaped markup was independently reinvented on nearly every page, and a progress-bar CSS block was duplicated 5 times.

**Forecast Engine was the most "vibe-coded" page in the app** and got a real content fix, not just a reskin: its "confidence %" was `85 + Math.random() * 10` and its trend chart was synthesized from a single `progress` number — both deleted outright. Replaced with **real SHAP feature attributions**, which the backend pipeline already computes and stores per-project in `predictions.shap_explanation` (`backend/maagap/explainability.py::format_shap_json()`) but the frontend never read. New `GET /api/projects/[projectId]` serves this on demand (not bundled into the list payload every consumer pays for), with real feature names (`contractor_reliability`, `typhoon_exposure`, `budget_log`, etc., from `backend/maagap/feature_engineering.py`) mapped through a new `frontend/src/lib/shapLabels.ts` friendly-label table.

**Projects' sort controls were fixed for real** (previously buttons with no handler at all) and a Risk Tier filter was added. **Model Validation was reframed around triage**: the 4 stat tiles are now clickable filters (clicking "Contradicted" filters the table to it), matching Dashboard's "surface what needs attention" pattern rather than one flat, unfilterable table.

**New shared code**: `ProgressBar` primitive (5th duplicate found, built now since Projects needed it) and `frontend/src/lib/riskTone.ts` (the `RISK_TONE` map, deduplicated out of Dashboard/Projects/Model Validation all needing the identical mapping). **`Notice` was deliberately not built in this group** — the audit found its real need is Login/Account/Users' success/error banners (Group C), not Group A; built primitives only when a second real usage exists, not speculatively.

## Add new PPA (manual project entry)

**Decision**: While rebuilding Projects, "Add new PPA" and "Import Data" were found to be pure decoration (no `onClick` at all) and removed as dead code. The user then asked for "Add new PPA" to actually be built (Import Data stays deferred — smaller, lower-risk scope chosen deliberately).

**The real constraint surfaced immediately**: the ML pipeline (risk scoring, SHAP, LP allocation) is a **batch, offline process** (`python main.py`, ~5-8 min), not on-demand per-project inference. A manually-added PPA cannot get an immediate risk tier. Resolved by showing it as **"Pending Assessment"** (a new `risk: "Pending"` value, tone `neutral`, sorts first via `RISK_ORDER.Pending = -1`) until the next full pipeline run scores it — surfaced consistently across Projects, Dashboard, and Forecast Engine (the last shows a graceful "Not yet assessed" message instead of a 404 error when a pending project has no `predictions` row yet).

**Schema**: `is_manual_entry`/`created_by`/`created_at` columns (`backend/supabase/schema_manual_entry.sql`) distinguish a genuinely new, not-yet-scored PPA from the ~2550 historical (non-monitored) rows already in `projects` — without that flag, "show projects with no prediction yet" would incorrectly surface that entire historical backlog too, not just new entries.

**A real gap surfaced immediately after shipping this**: `projects` never had a `project_name` or `description` column at all — every page has always displayed `project_id` as the "name," for the entire synthetic/historical cohort, not just new entries. Added both as nullable columns (existing rows fall back to `project_id`, so nothing regresses); `AddPpaModal` now requires a real Project Name and accepts an optional Description, both surfaced in Forecast Engine's summary panel. **The user flagged that this should eventually apply to the existing ~450 (and ultimately ~3000) projects too** — a data-backfill task, not yet scoped, likely touching `backend/maagap/synthetic_generator.py` so future pipeline runs generate real names too. See [[06-Current-State-and-Next-Steps]] for this as an open next step.

**Domain values are real, not invented**: project type (Infrastructure=12mo/Non-Infrastructure=6mo, a fixed manuscript rule — not a free-entry duration field, since temporal feature engineering elsewhere assumes `duration_months // 3` quarters), 14 implementing agencies, 10 funding sources, 40 municipalities — all transcribed from `backend/maagap/config.py` into `frontend/src/lib/ppaOptions.ts`, which points back to that file as the source of truth.

**Consequence**: the pending-entries query in `GET /api/projects` is wrapped in its own inner try/catch, isolated from the main handler — a real regression was caught during review where a schema-not-yet-applied failure in the new code broke the *entire* endpoint, including the existing scored-project data that has nothing to do with this feature. Fixed so a missing migration degrades to "no pending entries shown" rather than breaking Projects/Dashboard/Forecast Engine for everyone.

## Every PPA needs a real name + description (not just manual entries)

**Decision**: While reviewing "Add new PPA," the user pointed out PPAs should have an identifying name and description, not just an ID — and that this should eventually apply to the *existing* ~450/~3000 project cohort too, not only newly-added ones. Added `projects.project_name`/`projects.description` as nullable columns (existing rows fall back to `project_id` for display, so nothing regresses); `AddPpaModal` requires a real Project Name and accepts an optional Description. **Backfilling real names/descriptions onto the existing synthetic/historical cohort is a separate, not-yet-scoped follow-up** (likely touching `backend/maagap/synthetic_generator.py` so future pipeline runs generate them too) — see [[06-Current-State-and-Next-Steps]].

## Import Data (bulk CSV PPA import)

**Decision**: Right after Add New PPA shipped, the user asked for the previously-deferred "Import Data" (bulk CSV) to be built too. Scoped via clarifying questions: a **preview table before committing** (parse + validate every row client-side, show per-row Valid/Error status with the specific reason, only valid rows get created on confirm — never a silent partial import) and a **downloadable CSV template** with the exact expected headers plus one real example row.

**Validation was extracted, not duplicated**: `frontend/src/lib/ppaValidation.ts::validatePpaRow()` is the one set of rules used by both the single-add route and the new `POST /api/projects/bulk` route (and the bulk route re-validates server-side even though the client already filtered to valid rows in the preview — never trust client-side validation alone as the sole gate). Same reasoning for `frontend/src/lib/projectId.ts::createProjectIdAllocator()` — fetches existing `PROJ-%` ids once and hands out sequential ids per year in-memory, so a single bulk batch spanning multiple years never collides with itself, reused by both routes instead of the single-add route's original per-request "query max, increment" approach.

**CSV parsing is hand-rolled**, not a reintroduced dependency: `papaparse` was deliberately removed from this project during the earlier Supabase migration (see the "consolidate /api/projects" progress entry). A ~30-line quoted-field parser (`frontend/src/lib/csv.ts`) covers a controlled, self-authored template format without bringing that dependency back.

**UI iteration**: the first pass used a raw `<input type="file">`, which the user immediately flagged as visually out of place against the rest of the token-based design system (a screenshot made the mismatch obvious). Rebuilt as a proper drag-and-drop dropzone with a file chip (name/size/"Change file") once a file is selected, a real button (not a text link) for the template download, and numbered step labels ("Step 1/2/3") — legitimate here since uploading, previewing, and confirming genuinely is a fixed sequence, not decoration for its own sake.
